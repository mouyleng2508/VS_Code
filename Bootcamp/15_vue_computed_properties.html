<!-- Computed properties are very handy for composing 
    new data from existing sources, and one of the big 
    advantages they have over methods is that their 
    output is cached. This means that if something 
    independent of the computed property changes on 
    the page and the UI is re-rendered, the cached 
    result will be returned, and the computed property 
    will not be re-calculated, sparing us a potentially 
    expensive operation. -->
